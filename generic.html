									<h1>Capital One Hackathon</br>-Winner-</h1>
									<p><b>Problem statement:</b> Measuring Gender Equality and Work-Life Opportunities at the workplace</p>
									<p><b>Tools Used: Python, nltk, Machine Learning, Web scraping, Tableau</b></p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/gender.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><h2 align="center">Motivation: </h2>According to a Mckinsey Report, if a company becomes more diverse, it is 21% more likely to see above average profits and according to a report by IBM, if a company fully focuses on gender diversity, it sees higher profits and revenues by ~10% points.
									Looking at these numbers, I felt that if I could help company figure out where they stand in terms of gender equality and work-life opportunities with respect to the other companies and eventually improve, they can increase their profits and revenues.									.</p>
								</br>
								<h2 align="center">My approach:</h2>
								<p><b>1. Research</b> After understanding the problem statement and finding my motivation, I started researching about what contributes to the gender equality and work life opportunities at a workplace and if data for same is available. After researching several websites, I decided to work with 13 metrics such as % of women executives, work from home option available, pay transparency, maternity leave etc. </p>
								<p><b>2. One more metric:</b> After further thinking, I realized that the 13 metrics I have decided to work with, only tells what an employer is offering
								 and not what the employees feel about what is being offered to them. Hence, I included the 14th metric which is the sentiment analysis of the employee reviews. I webscraped the data and conducted sentiment analysis using nltk.</p>
								 
								 <div align="center"><img src="images/metrics.JPG" alt="" /></div></br>
								 <p><b>Score Calculation: </b>I gathered the data for all 14 metrics for around 100 companies and created a form for Capital One to enter its data.
								Then, I calculated the scores for individual companies by assigning non-equal weights to each metric and taking the weighted average of them.</p>
								
								 <p><b>Comparison and Recommender system: </b> Now I had score for all the companies and data of 14 metrics for each company. I used Tableau for comparison. Next, I built a recommender system based on the financial data of the companies (not limited to revenue, profit and fortune 500 rank) because I felt that a company would want a direct comparison with its competitors. Hence, I used KNN algorithm to find the financially nearest company of Capital One. </p>
								 <p><b>Dashboard creation: </b>As HR department of a company would be using this tool, I wanted to use a tool that could easily be understood and worked with in case of any changes. Hence, I decided to go ahead with Tableau and assembled all my work as a dashboard. Please find below a demo of my dashboard: </p>

								<p><b>Where can this be used? </b>This tool can be used by companies to see what others are doing better and work on that. It can also be used by a company to compare its branches.</p>
								<p><b>*There were around 200 people registered for the hackathon and I took part as an individual.</b></br><b>***Comparisons may not be very accurate in the demo as webscaping for demo purpose was done only for limited reviews.</b></p></br>
